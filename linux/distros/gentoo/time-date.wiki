=== How to set time ===
		- Run the following
			- You need root permissions to change time
			- `echo "Asia/Kolkata" > /etc/timezone`
				- To see all the timezones run `ls /usr/share/zoneinfo`
			- `emerge --config sys-libs/timezone-data`
		- Now you should be good to go

=== How to set time manually ===
		- Here I'm going set time to 6:53(12h format)/ 18:53(24h format)
			- You should use 24h time format to set the time and also you should
			  pass the offset here as I'm in India it is +05:30
			- `hwclock --set --date 18:53:00+05:30 --local`
				- To set for _utc_ use _--utc_ instead of _--local_
				- Here _18:53:00:+05:30_ is _hours(24h format):minutes:seconds:+offset_
			- `hwclock --hctosys`
		- Now you should be good to go
