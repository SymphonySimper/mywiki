=== Wrong time in websites ===
	To fix this
		- Edit _/etc/conf.d/hwclock_
			- set `clock="local"` and
			  run `rc-service hwclock restart`
			- now to set the time run `hwclock --hctosys`
		- Once this is done your time issue should be fixed
		- But _date_ command will not display the local time, to do
		  so run `date -u` everytime you run the date command.
