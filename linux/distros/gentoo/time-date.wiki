=== How to set time ===
	To set time(atleas the way I like to do)
		- Run the following
		{{{
			echo "UTC" > /etc/timezone
			emerge --config sys-libs/timezone-data
			# Now to set the correct time run the following
			# Here I'm going set time to 6:53(12h format)/ 18:53(24h format)
			# You should use 24h time format to set the time
			hwclock --set --date 18:53
			hwclock --hctosys
			rc-service hwclock restart
		}}}
		- Now you should be good to go
			- Here `date` and `date -u` will produce the expected result

==== Why this method? ====
	I found this by accident while I was playing with _EndeavourOS_ in the live environment.
As I had issues with time where I would have to settle with either wrong time in webistes(uses utc) or
my cron wouldn't work. So it was frustrating experience to say the least. I tried a lot of things but
nothing would fix this and finally when I was playing with _EndeavourOS_, it had proper time and I wanted
to know how they did and thats how I ended up with this solution.
