=== General ===
	- Make sure picom/compton (any compositors) is not running, before playing.
	  As it will introduce input lags.
	- For an nvidia gpu pass _*prime-run*_ as an launch option. This runs the game with _dgpu_.
	- For _steam_ games lookup the [[#Steam|steam section]].

=== Steam ===
==== Launch options ====
 - `vblank_mode=0 prime-run %command%`
	- make sure _*nvidia prime*_ is installed
