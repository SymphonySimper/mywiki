=== Install ===

==== Debian/Ubuntu ====
	- Run `sudo apt install tcl nam ns2`
	- Thats it.

==== Compile yourself(couldn't get it to work) ====
	- *Dosen't work with gcc version greater than 4.8.0*
	- *Download*
		- [[https://github.com/SymphonySimper/ns-allinone-2.35|Fork of ns2 with added patch(recommended)]]
		- [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/postdownload|ns2 latest version(source forge)]]
			- It will download the latest version of ns2 available which is _2.35_
			- The download file zip will be named as _ns-allione-2.35.tar.gz_
	- Extract the downloaded file
		- To extract the downloaded file
			1. Run `cd Downloads` in your terminal
				- _Downloads_ here refers to the directory where the file is kept
				  it may be different in your case.
			2. Now to extract the zip run `tar -xzf ns-allione-2.35.tar.gz`
			3. Once the extraction is complete, run `cd ns-allinone-2.35`
			4. Then run `./install` to install ns2
				- This may take some time depeding upon your hardware as the program
				  needs to be compiled.
				- If everything goes well then that's it
			5. Now follow the steps in the output and add *PATH* and *LD_LIBRARY_PATH*
			   to your *.profile* file or to your shell *rc* file.
				- Then source the file by running `source .profile` or `source .rc`
				  respectively.
				- Once that is done run `ns` to check wether the environment variables
				  are set properly.
			6. Now to validate your build (i.e) to check wether ns2 is properly
			   installed run `./validate`

==== I'm not using debian/debian based distro ====
	You my friend is out of luck. If you are able to find *gcc version 4.8.0* and *lower*
try compiling it might work if not. Run a *kvm/vm* with a debian/debian based distro.

==== I use windows/macos ====
	WHY?
